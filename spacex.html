        <h1>Space X Starlink</h1>
        <hr>
        <img src="./images/techtalk/spacex-starlink(1).jpg" alt="">
        <p>Starlink is a satellite constellation development project by SpaceX, to develop a low-cost, high-performance
            satellite bus and requisite customer ground transceivers to implement a new spaceborne Internet
            communication system. SpaceX has said it will offer speeds of up to 1 Gbit/s, with latencies between 25 ms
            and 35 ms. Those latencies would make SpaceX's service comparable to cable and fiber, while existing
            satellite broadband services have latencies of 600 ms or more, according to FCC measurements. </p>

        <h3>HOW IT WORKS?</h3>
        <p>Each Starlink satellite is equipped with four powerful phased array antennas that are capable of an enormous
            amount of throughput when it comes to radio waves. Therefore, internet signal can be communicated up to a
            satellite and spread out through the network before being fired back down again to any location on Earth.
            Delivering internet via satellite is much more efficient because the signal travels 47% faster as a wave
            through the vacuum of space than it does being channelled along a fibre optic cable buried in the ground.
            From an infrastructure perspective, it also means there’s no need to lay vast amounts of cabling across
            parts of the world. Current satellites sending internet signals are around 22,236 miles (35,786 km) above
            the Earth. This results in a time delay in sending and receiving data. Starlink satellites are smaller and
            orbit closer, meaning they can carry and triangulate data much faster.</p>
        <img src="./images/techtalk/spacex-starlink(2).jpg" alt="">

        <h3>ADVANTAGES</h3>
        <p><strong>High-Speed Broadband</strong></p>
        <p>Estimates suggest that Starlink may offer 1Gb/s download speeds once the system is fully operational, far
            exceeding the beta’s speeds of 50-150Mb/s. Even at the lowest speeds, Starlink's beta is still able to
            provide 10x the minimum requirements for HD streaming.</p>
        <p><strong>Low Latency</strong></p>
        <p>Starlink's satellites will be in low Earth orbit, just 550km above the Earth's surface and 60x lower than
            existing networks. This greatly reduces the distance signals need to travel. A lower orbit ensures
            drastically lower latency, with Starlink expecting just 20-40ms of latency, compared to the 600ms of
            traditional satellites. Low latency brings with it the ability or video calls and online gaming for those in
            areas without reliable internet.</p>
        <p><strong>Customer Base</strong></p>
        <p>Starlink has the potential to bring broadband to billions, as it doesn’t rely on ground infrastructure
            Starlink can bypass geographic and economic boundaries which typically constrain the expansion of broadband.
            The network will have a potential customer base spanning not only the developing world but also the
            developed world, as many in rural regions still struggle with poor quality internet connections.</p>

        <h3>DISADVANTAGES</h3>
        <p><strong>Orbital Traffic</strong></p>
        <p>With increasing satellite numbers come fears that crashes will become a greater risk. With a potential fleet
            of 42,000 satellites, increasing overall numbers by 15x, Starlink could pose a threat to existing and future
            orbital projects. The European Space Agency reported in September 2019 that it had performed evasive
            manoeuvres, for the first time, to avoid a Starlink satellite. However, SpaceX has sought to relieve fears
            by incorporating an automatic avoidance system using data provided by NORAD, to prevent any further
            incidents.</p>
        <p><strong>Space Debris</strong></p>
        <p>Alongside traffic, debris left by damaged or retired satellites, poses an increasing threat to orbital
            safety. The emergence of 'space junk' has the potential to obliterate the world's orbital capabilities
            through exponential chain reactions. SpaceX promises that Starlink's low orbiting altitude will prevent
            debris, as 95% of the satellite is designed to burn up in the atmosphere once decommissioned. SpaceX has
            also made it clear that future Starlink satellites will burn up completely.</p>
        <p><strong>Brightening the Night Sky</strong></p>
        <p>Astronomers are particularly concerned that the scale and low orbit of the project will fill the night sky
            with reflections, ruining stargazing conditions. SpaceX has responded to this criticism, seeking ways to
            reduce the visibility of their satellites, such as an experimental system called DarkSat, which involved
            blackening as much of the satellite's reflective surfaces as possible. While DarkSat did result in a 55%
            reduction in visibility it has proved unsustainable due to conduction problems. Future Starlink designs are
            set to feature visors, limiting the amount of reflected light</p>
        <h3>IS STARLINK REALLY WORTH IT?</h3>
        <p>Despite competition and technical challenges, Starlink appears to be poised to provide a revolutionary global
            service, offering high-speed broadband across the globe. The use of SpaceX's reusable rockets is seeing 60
            satellites put into orbit per mission, rapidly expanding the network's size and capabilities.The growth
            potential is huge, provided SpaceX successfully manages to scale up the network and reduce prices. However,
            it is important to note that Starlink is not intended to replace existing ADSL, Fibre Optic, or Cable
            services, as it simply cannot compete in terms of speed or latency. Instead, Starlink is aimed at connecting
            those without access to these services, a potential game-changer for remote areas and the developing world.
