        <p>The Mars Helicopter Scout (MHS) is a planned robotic helicopter that tests the technology to scout
            interesting targets for study on Mars, and it helps plan the best driving route for future Mars rovers. The
            Mars Helicopter Scout (MHS) is a technology demonstrator by JPL that assesses whether this technology can
            fly safely. It provides better mapping and guidance that would give future mission controllers more
            information to help with travel routes planning and hazard avoidance, as well as identifying points of
            interest for the rover. The helicopter provides overhead images with approximately ten times greater
            resolution than orbital images, and displays features that may be occluded from the rover cameras. This
            technology forms the foundation on which more capable helicopters can be developed for aerial exploration of
            Mars and other planetary targets with an atmosphere. </p>

        <p>The Mars Helicopter Scout (MHS) is a planned robotic helicopter that tests the technology to scout
            interesting targets for study on Mars, and it helps plan the best driving route for future Mars rovers. The

            technology forms the foundation on which more capable helicopters can be developed for aerial exploration of
            Mars and other planetary targets with an atmosphere.</p>
        <img src="./images/techtalk/jpl-helicopter(3).jpg" alt="">
        <p>The helicopter uses counter-rotating coaxial rotors about 1.1 m in diameter. Its payload is a high resolution
            downward-looking camera for navigation, landing, and science surveying of the terrain, and a communication
            system to relay data to the Mars rover. Although it is an aircraft, it is being constructed as a spacecraft
            in order to endure the gravitational force and vibration during launch. It also includes radiation-resistant
            systems capable of operating in the frigid environment of Mars. The inconsistent Mars magnetic field
            precludes the use of a compass for navigation, so it uses a solar tracker camera integrated to JPL’s visual
            inertial navigation system. Some additional inputs include gyros, visual odometry, tilt sensors, altimeter,
            and hazard detectors. It uses solar panels to recharge its batteries, which are six Sony Li-ion cells with a
            nameplate capacity of 2 Ah.</p>
        <p>The prototype uses the Snapdragon processor from Intrinsyc with a Linux operating system, which also
            implements visual navigation via a velocity estimate derived from features tracked with a camera. The
            processor is connected to two flight-control Microcontroller Units (MCU) to perform the needed
            flight-control functions. Communications with the rover are through a radio link called Zig-Bee, a standard
            900 MHz chipset that will be mounted in both the rover and helicopter. The communication system is designed
            to relay data at 250 Kbit/s over distances of up to 1,000 m. The helicoptertravels by attaching to the
            underside of the rover, and is deployed to the surface between 60 and 90 Martian days after the landing.
            Then, the rover will drive approximately 100 meters away for the test flights to begin. This technology
            demonstration forms the foundation on which more capable helicopters can be developed for more ambitious
            missions to planets and moons with an atmosphere. The next generation of rotorcraft may be in the range
            between 5 and 15 kg with science payloads between 0.5 and 1.5 kg. These potential aircraft could have direct
            communication to an orbiter and may or may not continue to work with a landed asset. Future helicopters
            could be used to explore special regions with exposed water ice or brines where Earth microbial life could
            potentially survive. Mars helicopters may also be considered for fast retrieval of small sample caches back
            to a Mars ascent vehicle for return to Earth.</p>
