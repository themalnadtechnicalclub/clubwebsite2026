        <h1>Blue Brain</h1>
        <hr>
        <img src="./images/techtalk/blue-brain(2).jpg" alt="">
        <p>The Blue Brain project is the first comprehensive attempt to reverse-engineer the mammalian brain, in order
            to understand brain function and dysfunction through detailed supercomputer-based reconstructions and
            simulations. The project aims to build comprehensive digital reconstructions of the brain which can be used
            to study the nature of the brain. This, in turn, helps in understanding how human beings process emotions,
            thoughts, and give us deeper insight into the decision making power of the human brain. </p>
        <img src="./images/techtalk/blue-brain(3).jpg" alt="">
        <p>The blue brain project (BPP) makes use of the Blue Gene supercomputer developed by IBM to carry out
            simulations. Hence the project is named the “Blue Brain“. The project was founded by Henry Markram at the
            École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Lausanne, Switzerland way back in May 2005. EPFL is a
            research institute that specializes in natural sciences and engineering.Today scientists are carrying out
            research to create an artificial brain that can think, respond, take decisions and store information. The
            main aim is to upload a human brain into the computer, so that it can think, and make decisions without the
            presence of a human body. After death, this virtual brain can act as the man. So, even after the death of a
            person, we will not lose the knowledge, intelligence, emotions, and memories of a person and this can be
            used for various situations like to continue the pending work, to decide on something based on his/her area
            of expertise etc.</p>

        <h3>WHAT IS VIRTUAL BRAIN?</h3>
        <p>A virtual brain is an artificial brain. It can think like the natural brain, take decisions based on the past
            experience, and respond as the natural brain can. It is possible to do so by using supercomputers, with a
            huge amount of storage capacity, processing power and an interface between the human brain and this
            artificial one. Through this interface, the data stored in the natural brain can be uploaded into the
            computer. So the brain and the knowledge, intelligence of anyone can be preserved and used forever, even
            after the death of the person.</p>
        <h3>WHY DO WE NEED VIRTUAL BRAIN?</h3>
        <p>Today we are developed because of our intelligence. Intelligence is the inborn quality that cannot be
            created. Some people have this quality so that they can think to such an extent where others cannot reach.
            Human society would always need such intelligence and such an intelligent brain. But the intelligence is
            lost along with the person after death. Virtual brain is a solution to it. The brain and its intelligence
            can be alive even after death. We often face difficulties in remembering things such as people’s names,
            their birthdays, and the spellings of words, proper grammar, important dates, history facts, etc. A virtual
            brain can take away the extra stress we all face to remember things. It is a perfect technical solution to a
            very common human problem.</p>
        <h3>HOW DOES THE NATURAL BRAIN WORK?</h3>
        <p>The human brain is a complex system consisting of recursive connectors. It is more complex than any circuitry
            in the world. The human brain is a multi-level system with 100 billion neurons (nerve cells) and 100
            trillion synapses. A neuron is a cell designed to transmit information to other nerve cells, muscle, or
            gland cells whereas synapses help neurons to communicate with each other. The human ability to feel,
            interpret and even see is controlled, in computer-like calculations, by the magical nervous system. Yes, the
            nervous system is quite like a magic because we can’t see it, but it is working through electric impulses
            through our body. To understand this system, one has to know following three simple functions:-</p>
        <p><strong>SENSORY INPUT:</strong></p>
        <p>When our eyes see something or when our hands touch a warm surface, the sensory cells, also known as Neurons,
            send a message straight to our brain. This is called sensory input because we are putting things into our
            brain by way of senses.</p>
        <p><strong>INTEGRATION: </strong></p>
        <p>Integration is best known as the interpretation of things like taste, touch, and sense which is possible
            because of our sensory cells, known as neurons. Billions of neurons work together to understand the change
            around us.</p>
        <p><strong>MOTOR OUTPUT : </strong></p>
        <p>Once our brain understands the change, either by touching, tasting or via any other medium, then our brain
            sends a message through neurons to effector cells, muscles or gland cells, which actually work to perform
            our requests and act upon our environment. The word motor output is easily remembered if one should think
            that our putting something out into the environment through the use of a motor, like a muscle which does the
            work for our body</p>
        <h3>IS IT POSSIBLE TO COPY DATA FROM BRAIN TO THE COMPUTER?</h3>
        <p>The uploading is possible by the use of small robots known as the Nanobots. These robots are small enough to
            travel throughout our circulatory system. Traveling into the spine and brain, they will be able to monitor
            the activity and structure of our central nervous system. They will be able to provide an interface with
            computers. Nanobots could also carefully scan the structure of our brain, providing a complete readout of
            the connections. This information, when entered into a computer, could then continue to function as us.
            Thus, the entire data in the brain will be uploaded into the computer.</p>
        <h3>ADVANTAGES</h3>
        <p>- Even after the death of a person his intelligence can be used.</p>
        <p>- This could boost study of animal behavior. That means by interpretation of the electric impulses from the
            brain of the animals, their thought process can be understood easily.</p>
        <p>- It would allow the deaf to hear via direct nerve stimulation, and also be helpful for many psychological
            diseases.</p>
        <p>- We could make use of the information of the brain that was uploaded into the computer and use it to provide
            a solution to mental disorder.</p>
        <h3>DISADVANTAGES</h3>
        <p>There could be new types of threats, this technology would bring. <br>
            - Increases the dependency on computer systems. <br>
            - Computer viruses will pose an increasingly critical threat. Data could be manipulated and used in wrong
            way. <br>
            - This may lead to human cloning and we cannot imagine how big this threat would be against nature.</p>

        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>The blue brain project, if implemented successfully, would indeed change many things around us and it will
            boost the area of research and technology. Certain research and development take decades or even centuries
            to complete, so the knowledge and efforts of a scientist can be preserved and used further in his absence.
            At the same time, it is not an easy task to replicate the convoluted brain system into a computer. It may
            take several years to decades to accomplish this.</p>
