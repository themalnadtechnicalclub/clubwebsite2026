        <h1>Block Chain</h1>
        <hr>
        <img src="./images/techtalk/block-chain(2).jpg" alt="">
        <p>Blockchain is incredibly popular nowadays. As the name indicates, a blockchain is a chain
            of blocks that contain information. This method was originally described in 1991 by a group of researchers
            and was originally ntended to time stamp digital documents (like a notary). It was mostly unused until it
            was adapted by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 to create the digital cryptocurrency bitcoin. A block chain is a
            distributed ledger that is completely open to anyone. Once data has been recorded inside a block chain, it
            becomes very difficult to change it. </p>

        <h3>Working of Block Chain</h3>
        <p>In a blockchain each block contains some data, hash value of the block and hash value of the previous block.
            The data that is stored inside a block depends on the type of blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain for
            example, stores the details about a transaction such as the sender, receiver and number of coins. A block
            also has a hash. You can compare a hash to a fingerprint. It identifies a block and all of its contents and
            it's always unique, just like a fingerprint. Once a block is created, its hash is calculated. Changing
            something inside the block will cause the hash to change. So, in other words: hashes are very useful when
            you want to detect changes to blocks. If the fingerprint of a block changes, it is no longer the same block.
            The third element inside each block is the hash of the previous block. This effectively creates a chain of
            blocks and it's this technique that makes a blockchain so secure. The first block is a bit special; it
            cannot point to previous blocks because it's the first one. This is the genesis block. Using hashes is not
            enough to prevent tampering. Computers these days are very fast and can calculate hundreds of thousands of
            hashes per second. You could effectively tamper with a block and recalculate all the hashes of other blocks
            to make your blockchain valid again. So, to mitigate this, blockchains have something called proof-of-work.
            It's a mechanism that slows down the creation of new blocks. But there is one more way that blockchains
            secure themselves and that's by being distributed. Instead of using a central entity to manage the chain,
            blockchains use a peer-to-peer network and anyone is allowed to join. When someone joins this network, he
            gets the full copy of the blockchain. The node can use this to verify that everything is still in order.
            When someone creates a new block, that new block is sent to everyone on the network. Each node then verifies
            the block to make sure that it hasn't been tampered with. If everything checks out, each node adds this
            block to its own blockchain. All the nodes in this network create consensus. They agree about which blocks
            are valid and which aren't. Blocks that are tampered with will be rejected by other nodes in the network.
            So, to successfully tamper with a blockchain you'll need to tamper with all blocks on the chain, redo the
            proof-of-work for each block and take control of more than 50% of the peer-to-peer network. Only then will
            your tampered block become accepted by everyone else. Blockchains are also constantly evolving. One of the
            more recent developments is the creation of smart contracts. These contracts are simple programs that are
            stored on the blockchain and can be used to automatically exchange coins based on certain conditions.</p>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <p><strong>Distributed</strong>-Since blockchain data is often stored in thousands of devices on a distributed
            network of nodes, the system and the data are highly resistant to technical failures and malicious attacks.
            Each network node is able to replicate and store a copy of the database and, because of this, there is no
            single point of failure: a single node going offline does not affect the availability or security of the
            network.</p>
        <p><strong>Stability-</strong>Confirmed blocks are very unlikely to be reversed, meaning that once data has been
            registered into the blockchain, it is extremely difficult to remove or change it.</p>
        <p><strong>Trustless System</strong> -In most traditional payment systems, transactions are not only dependent
            on the two parties involved, but also on an intermediary - such as a bank, credit card company, or payment
            provider. When using blockchain technology, this is no longer necessary because the distributed network of
            nodes verify the transactions through a process known as mining. For this reason, Blockchain is often
            referred to as a 'trustless' system. Therefore, a blockchain system negates the risk of trusting a single
            organization and also reduces the overall costs and transaction fees by cutting out intermediaries and third
            parties.</p>
        <h3>Disadvangtages</h3>
        <p><strong>51% Attacks-</strong> In most traditional payment systems, transactions are not only dependent on the
            two parties involved, but also on an intermediary - such as a bank, credit card company, or payment
            provider. When using blockchain technology, this is no longer necessary because the distributed network of
            nodes verify the transactions through a process known as mining. For this reason, Blockchain is often
            referred to as a 'trustless' system. Therefore, a blockchain system negates the risk of trusting a single
            organization and also reduces the overall costs and transaction fees by cutting out intermediaries and third
            parties Despite being theoretically possible, there was never a successful 51% attack on the Bitcoin
            blockchain. As the network grows larger the security increases and it is quite unlikely that miners will
            invest large amounts of money and resources to attack Bitcoin as they are better rewarded for acting
            honestly. Other than that, a successful 51% attack would only be able to modify the most recent transactions
            for a short period of time because blocks are linked through cryptographic proofs (changing older blocks
            would require intangible levels of computing power). Also, the Bitcoin blockchain is very resilient and
            would quickly adapt as a response to an attack.</p>
        <p><strong>Data Modification-</strong>Another downside of blockchain systems is that once data has been added to
            the blockchain it is very difficult to modify it. While stability is one of blockchain’s advantages, it is
            not always good. Changing blockchain data or code is usually very demanding and often requires a hard fork,
            where one chain is abandoned, and a new one is taken up.</p>
        <p><strong>Private Keys</strong> -Blockchain uses public-key (or asymmetric) cryptography to give users
            ownership over their cryptocurrency units (or any other blockchain data). Each blockchain address has a
            corresponding private key. While the address can be shared, the private key should be kept secret. Users
            need their private key to access their funds, meaning that they act as their own bank. If a user loses their
            private key, the money is effectively lost, and there is nothing they can do about it.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Inefficient-</strong>Blockchains, especially those using Proof of Work, are highly inefficient. Since
            mining is highly competitive and there is just one winner every ten minutes, the work of every other miner
            is wasted. As miners are continually trying to increase their computational power, so that they have a
            greater chance of finding a valid block hash, the resources used by the Bitcoin network has increased
            significantly in the last few years, and it currently consumes more energy than many countries, such as
            Denmark, Ireland, and Nigeria. Storage -Blockchain ledgers can grow very large over time. The Bitcoin
            blockchain currently requires around 200 GB of storage. The current growth in blockchain size appears to be
            outstripping the growth in hard drives and the network risks losing nodes if the ledger becomes too large
            for individuals to download and store.</p>
        <h3>Future Scope and Application</h3>
        <p>- Storing medical records</p>
        <p>- Creating a digital notary</p>
        <p>- Collecting taxes.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Blockchain technology is revolutionary. It will make life simpler and safer, changing the way personal
            information is stored and how transactions for goods and services are made. Blockchain technology creates a
            permanent and immutable record of every transaction. This impenetrable digital ledger makes fraud, hacking,
            data theft, and information-loss impossible. The technology will affect every industry in the world,
            including manufacturing, retail, transportation, healthcare, and real estate companies.</p>
