        <h1>Neuralink</h1>
        <hr>
        <img src="./images/techtalk/Neuralink(2).jpeg" alt="">
        <p>Relationship psychologists have shown that people’s trust in artificial intelligence (AI) is tied to their
            relationship or attachment style. As progress in traditional computing slows, new forms of computing are
            coming to the forefront. A team of engineers are attempting to pioneer a type of computing that mimics the
            efficiency of the brain’s neural networks while exploiting the brain’s analog nature.Scientists have
            discovered a new way to connect human brains to computers - through veins.

        <h3>WHAT IS NEURALINK?</h3>
        <p>Neuralink is a device that will be surgically implanted into your brain and with it, you’ll be able to
            communicate with machines and even control them. It will also help study the electrical signals in the brain
            and arrive at solutions that can help cure various medical problems. With Neuralink a chipset, called N1
            chipset, will be installed in your skull which is 8mm in diameter and has multiple wires housing electrodes
            and insulation for the wires.</p>
        <img src="./images/techtalk/Neuralink(3).jpeg" alt="">
        <h3>HOW DOES NEURALINK WORK?</h3>
        <p>Your brain sends information to different parts of your body using neurons. These neurons in your brain
            connect with each other to form a large network and communicate using chemical signals called
            neurotransmitters. This reaction generates an electric field and you can record these reactions by placing
            electrodes nearby.</p>
        <h3>HOW IS NEURALINK INSTALLED?</h3>
        <p>Neuralink will be using its specially developed robots to carry out the quick and precise insertion of the
            device into the cortex. The Neuralink robot will insert the module into your brain using a microscope and
            needles the size of 24 microns (a micron is one-millionth of a meter). These needles are so small that you
            can’t easily spot them with the naked eye. The operation will require a 2mm incision which will be dilated
            up to 8mm. After the procedure is complete the exposed part of the skull will be covered with the chipset
            module. The installation procedure could take up to two hours according to Musk and the person could also be
            under partial anaesthesia during the process.</p>
        <h3>ADVANTAGES</h3>
        <p>- The machine will be able to help paraplegics with simple tasks like operating a phone or interacting with a
            computer. It may also be used to treat epilepsy. <br>
            - The device will also be able to help regain someone’s eyesight even if they have lost their optic nerve.
            <br>
            - Neuralink can also be used to restore memory, speech and movement of a paralysed person. <br>
            - It will also be able to help humans interact with each other without the need to actually talk.
        </p>
        <h3>DISADVANTAGES</h3>
        <p>- If the device is connected to the internet how will we be protected against hackers who might try to steal
            data directly from our brains. <br>
            - Some unknown long-term impact on the brain from decomposition by the body of the electrode materials over
            time. <br>
            - Chip has the potential to decrease the work of the biological version of brain.</p>
        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
        <p>The Neuralink project, if implemented successfully, would indeed change many things around us and it will
            boost the area of research and technology. Certain research and development take decades or even centuries
            to complete, so the knowledge and efforts of a scientist can be preserved and used further in his absence.
            At the same time, it is not an easy task to replicate the convoluted brain system into a computer chip. It
            may take several years to decades to accomplish this.</p>
